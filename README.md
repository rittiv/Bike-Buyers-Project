This project involves bike purchases from different ages of people who use it for thier commute to work.
The spreadsheet contains many information such as the ID of the customer, their marital status, their gender and etc.
These information helps to understand what their purchase choice or why they have not bought the bike.

The spreadsheet has many pivot tables and charts. With these information tables I am able to create a working dashboard which is fully reactive and helps for better visualisation.
